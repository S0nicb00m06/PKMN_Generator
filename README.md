# PKMN_Generator
Random Number Generator for Pokémon up to gen 5
This was made purely out of boredom and I wanted to spice up the way I played the old games.

It will first generate a type, then pick a pokémon from that type, then it generate an ability for it to use from either its regular or hidden abilities.

For added random meassure, it will also dictate its gender and whether or not it can evolve.

Then it will "judge" the result at the end.

You can decide how you want to use this thing, I would normally hit it when i get another gym badge to see what the next addition to my team will be. Alternatively, you can roll your whole team at the start of a run and roll with that.

It will include legendaries so if youre playing vanilla pokémon, you can reroll and try to play with what youre able to get.
